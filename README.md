# TimeSeries-Analysis
This project aims to predict forest cover loss using both deep learning (LSTM) and statistical (ARIMA) time series models. Historical forest loss data is preprocessed, scaled, and modeled using LSTM networks to capture temporal patterns. ARIMA is also applied for comparison, and predictions from both models are visualized and evaluated.
